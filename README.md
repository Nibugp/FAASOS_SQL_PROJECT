**Rebel Foods, formerly Faasos,** is a prominent Indian food delivery company founded in 2011. Initially a quick-service restaurant chain specializing in wraps, it transitioned to an online platform to meet the growing demand for convenient food options. Rebel Foods introduced the innovative "wraps on wheels" concept and expanded its menu to include a wide range of cuisines.

Leveraging technology, Rebel Foods streamlined the ordering process through a user-friendly app and website, and partnered with local restaurants to offer diverse dishes. The companyâ€™s growth and investment led to a rebrand as Rebel Foods, reflecting its global cloud kitchen network vision.

Today, Rebel Foods operates several brands, including Faasos, Behrouz Biryani, Oven Story, and Mandarin Oak. The company has transformed the food delivery industry in India with its extensive network of cloud kitchens and technology-driven solutions.
